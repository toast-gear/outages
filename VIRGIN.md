### Discount Plan

Call them up. Say you want to cancel, cannot afford it during this time. They’ll offer you a shit deal, say no you can’t afford it. Then they’ll transfer you through to someone who can offer you a better deal. But still act like you can’t afford it. I do this every year, I have a 15 pounds off my contract atm taking it from 42 quid to 27. Worth the effort once a year imo.
